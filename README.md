## Datasets Info
1. **2021-2022 Football Player Stats**: this dataset comprises a multitude of features extracted from football player statistics for the 2021-2022 season, aggregated per 90 minutes. It contains over 2500 rows and 143 columns. Due to significant feature overlap, we conducted preprocessing to select the most pertinent features (such as Goals, Recovering, Assists...).
2. **FIFA 22 complete player dataset**: this dataset provides a comprehensive list of players, supplemented with their profile pictures. We utilized the feature set from the first dataset and for each player, obtained the corresponding profile picture.
